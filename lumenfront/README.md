# CLIENT FOR LUMEN APP

## How to setup

Versions that code was tested on:

npm --version
8.1.0

Node --version
v16.13.0

https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Install missing modules via:

`$ npm install`

After modules are installed, run:

`$ npm run dev`

You can change the port to run on this:

`$ npm run dev -- -p <PORT NUMBER>`

Server is up and running, go check your browser!
For this app to be fully functional lumenback should also be running (check other README for that), needed for api requests.
